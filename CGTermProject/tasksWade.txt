CREATE BUBBLE TEST
	is similar to ray test

	HOW TO:
		create member in BaseProjectile for "previous position"
		write checkCollisions
			compare dot products of previous and current position
				checks if crosses the plane
					if so, check if point of intersection is closer than sum of target and bubble radii
					also check perpendicular distance to plane



2) fix how velocity of a projectile is set
	velocity could be a fixed magnitude from start, but direction is set from click

3) is proper plane distance being chosen? How is target being drawn?

4) make target not culled

5) ray target needs "straight through" test
	cross planes inside or something
